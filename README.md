# Statamic 2 Feature Requests and Bug Reports

Greetings, Statamagicians!
This repo is intended for Statamic 2 bug reports and feature requests.

## How to report a bug

1. Check to see if there's a similar issue filed already (open _or_ closed).
2. Make sure it's not a cache issue. Clear your cache using `php please cache:clear` or delete everything inside `local/cache` and `local/storage` and try again. If your issue goes away, let us know what happened so we can fine tune our cache invalidation.
3. Otherwise, [open an bug report issue](https://github.com/statamic/v2-hub/issues/new?template=Bug_report.md) with as much detail as you can. PHP/Server environment, content types, YAML/template examples, etc. Feel free to remove any non-applicable sections of the Issue template. Also, please be as kind and detailed as possible. It goes a long way towards finding a solution!

## Requesting a feature

Fire up [a feature request issue](https://github.com/statamic/v2-hub/issues/new?template=Feature_request.md) and give as much detail as possible!
